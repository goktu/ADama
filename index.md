## ADama Model

Dama means checkerboard in Turkish. The hypothetical optimal car formation in a 3x3 grid is a checkerboard, allowing a car to move forward and merge sideways without any disruption to the flow.

ADama is a nod to one of my favorite shows, [Battlestar Galactica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evodPpqb9H4). 

A cellular automaton (CA) is a search function around a cell. The conventional update rule is based on the cell values in a cell's neighborhood.

There is an inherent attraction and repulsion between two cars in a lane. The tailing car is aiming to move forward into the front car's current position in the next time frame. However, the car in the back needs to leave a trailing distance to avoid crashing into the front. This is akin to a repulsion force.

I hypothesize this attraction-repulsion between two cars in a lane is a **long-range dipole interaction** in the driving direction, and in its normal direction the lane merging, the **dipole vanishes**.

In order to simulate the act of driving in a CA, I had to inverse the update rule to initiate the motion from a cell, as it is the case with a car. A car is similar to a free radical.
